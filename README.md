## Introduction
This is a dashboard we created in D3 JS that showcases the effect of unemployment on Metro vs non-Metro areas in the US.

It based on the following two datasets from Kaggle:
- [Cost of Living](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/us-cost-of-living-dataset-3171-counties)
- [Unemployment](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valbauman/student-engagement-online-learning-supplement)

It includes the following charts:
- Barchart
- Choropleth map
- Linechart
